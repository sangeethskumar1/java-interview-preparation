What is Normalization
    Process used to organize a database in order to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity

    Goals
        Eliminate redundant data (for example, storing the same data in more than one table)
        Ensure data dependencies make sense (only storing related data in a table).

Different Types of Normalization
    1NF
        Ensure that each table column contains atomic (indivisible) values and that each column contains only one type of data
    2NF
        Achieved when a table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key
    3NF
        Achieved when a table is in 2NF and all the attributes are functionally independent of all other non-key attributes
